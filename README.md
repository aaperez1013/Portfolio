# Awin Apollo Perez's Teaching Portfolio

Hello! My name is Awin Apollo Perez, I am currently an undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego.

This is my teaching portfolio, most of which is material covered in my time taking EDS 124BR from UCSD! This is mostly demonstrations using code-block languages, such as Snap! or Sratch.
